  A RANDOM endpoint that randomly returns a park/business/animal.

  At least one of the objectives from Monday's Further Exploration lesson (such as versioning, token authentication, or serialization).

  Thorough exception handling.

  Complete testing with request specs.

  A README that thoroughly documents all endpoints, including parameters that can be passed in.
